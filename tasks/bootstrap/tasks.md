## Tests
- Unit tests for translator ingest.py: Validate contract generation, work order tables, diagram creation.
- Integration tests for backend service: Endpoint responses, file writes, error handling.
- E2E tests for console wiring: Button clicks trigger server calls, UI updates reflect backend state.

## Verification
- Coverage reports meet 85% threshold for new code.
- Trivy/OSV scans pass with no CRITICAL/HIGH vulnerabilities.
- Packet shapes validated against schema.py for all gate artifacts.
